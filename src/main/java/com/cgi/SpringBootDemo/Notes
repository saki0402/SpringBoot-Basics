@Scope(value="prototype") :the moment you say prototype the instance or obj will not be created by default for you.
it will be created when you ask for a bean or getBean() : 2 times obj created as we asked getBean two times. 
So object ondefault not created in spring container


	@Autowired: when we specify this as Autowired then only we get the bean or obj of laptop from the Spring Container 

		   context is the spring container here.and this gives 2 types of beans userdefined beans and AutoConfigure beans 
		   Auto configure Beans :the spring container makes an assumption that you require certain number of beans and it will provide you those
		   To make your classes to create objects by container we need to use configuration for that : @Component, @Autowired .......
		   context will initialize the container and during initialization it creates the objects for the components
		   bean means object

@Component  //this will create an object in the Spring container and to get the object of this they need to use @Autowired

	default name of Alien is alien in spring container
					Laptop is laptop
					
@Autowired : it bydefault searches by type 
@Qualifier : it by default searches by name
